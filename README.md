Bike Sharing Demand Prediction
This project aims to predict the bike rental demand using historical usage data, along with weather and seasonal information. The dataset contains records of bike rentals over time, with various features related to time, weather conditions, and user types (casual vs. registered).

Project Overview
With urban areas increasingly adopting bike-sharing programs, accurate demand forecasting is crucial for ensuring bike availability and efficient distribution. This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict daily and hourly bike rental counts, based on historical usage data, weather conditions, and time-related information.

Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project includes:

Train Dataset (train.csv): Contains features and target count values (number of rentals).
Test Dataset (test.csv): Contains only features; the task is to predict count values.
Sample Submission (sampleSubmission.csv): Used for testing and validation purposes.
Main Features
datetime: Timestamp of bike rental.
season: Season in which the rental occurred.
holiday: Whether the day was a holiday.
workingday: Whether the day was a working day.
weather: Weather condition (1: Clear, 2: Misty, 3: Light rain/snow, 4: Heavy rain/snow).
temp, atemp: Actual and perceived temperatures.
humidity, windspeed: Environmental conditions.
casual, registered, count: Number of rentals (casual and registered users) and total count (target).
Project Workflow
Data Loading and Cleaning: Load data, inspect for missing values, and clean outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize trends, correlations, and insights in the data.
Feature Engineering and Data Preprocessing:
Extract time-based features (e.g., year, month, hour, weekday).
One-hot encode categorical variables and scale numeric features.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduce dimensionality to remove redundant information.
Model Training:
Train multiple models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
Evaluate each model's performance using metrics like MAE, MSE, and R².
Model Testing: Evaluate selected models on the test dataset to determine the best fit.
Classification Report / Cost Analysis: If the demand prediction is categorized, create a classification report.
Final Prediction and Submission: Generate final predictions using the best model.

Usage
Load Data: Place train.csv, test.csv, and sampleSubmission.csv in the root directory.
Run the Project Notebook or Script:
Open Bike_Sharing_Demand_Prediction.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Colab.
Alternatively, run the Python script with python bike_sharing_demand.py.
Check Model Outputs: Predictions will be saved as a .csv file for further analysis or submission.
Results
After comparing model performances, the final model's evaluation is as follows:

Model	MAE	MSE	R²
Linear Regression	x.xxx	x.xxx	x.xxx
Random Forest	x.xxx	x.xxx	x.xxx
Gradient Boosting	x.xxx	x.xxx	x.xxx
Interpretation: The model with the lowest MAE/MSE and highest R² indicates the best predictive performance for bike sharing demand.

Conclusion
Insights:
Hourly, daily, and seasonal trends significantly affect bike demand.
Temperature, weather, and other environmental factors are also strong indicators of demand.
This project highlights the importance of time-based and environmental factors in predicting bike-sharing demand. Future improvements could include advanced time-series models like ARIMA or LSTM for better accuracy.
